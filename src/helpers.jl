            The makespan optimal solution is T = 8. However, the optimistic schedule
            will always prioritize task route planning for tasks 1,2, and 3 before 4.
            This leads to a double delay that will not be caught without backtracking
            in ISPS. Hence, the solver will return a solution with T = 9.
